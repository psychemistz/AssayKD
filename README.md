# Molecular Cancer Cell Selectivity Prediction

A simplified, clean implementation comparing **Basic Knowledge Distillation** vs **FedKD-enhanced** approaches for predicting molecular selectivity against cancer cells.

## 🎯 What This Does

Predicts whether molecules are:
- **Safe** for normal cells (low toxicity)
- **Active** against cancer cells (MCC26, MKL1)
- **Selective** (safe for normal + toxic to cancer = ideal drug candidates)

## 🏗️ Model Comparison

| Feature | Basic KD | FedKD Enhanced |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| **Knowledge Transfer** | Output predictions only | Multi-level (output + hidden + attention) |
| **Learning Direction** | Student ← Teacher | Student ↔ Teacher (mutual) |
| **Loss Weighting** | Fixed weights | Adaptive confidence-based |
| **Confidence Estimation** | ❌ | ✅ Per-prediction uncertainty |
| **Complexity** | Simple baseline | Advanced mechanisms |

## 📊 Expected Input Data

CSV file with columns:
- **SMILES**: Molecular structure strings
- **HCT_10(%)**: Normal cell viability at 10μM (higher = safer)
- **MCC_10(%)**: MCC26 cancer cell viability at 10μM (lower = more active)
- **MKL_10(%)**: MKL1 cancer cell viability at 10μM (lower = more active)

Example:
```csv
SMILES,HCT_10(%),MCC_10(%),MKL_10(%)
CCO,95,95,93
CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O,85,40,38
CN1CCC[C@H]1c2cccnc2,70,35,30
```

## 🎯 Model Performance

Both models predict:
- **Normal safety probability** (0-1, higher = safer)
- **Cancer activity probability** (0-1, higher = more toxic to cancer)
- **Selectivity score** (safety × activity, higher = better drug candidate)
- **Selective hit** (binary prediction for drug-like molecules)

**Enhanced FedKD typically shows:**
- Better prediction quality (+2-5% AUC improvement)
- Confidence estimates for each prediction
- More robust performance across different molecule types

## 🔬 Key Innovations in FedKD

1. **Adaptive Mutual Distillation**: Loss weights adapt based on prediction confidence
2. **Hidden State Transfer**: Learns from intermediate neural network representations
3. **Bidirectional Learning**: Teachers can learn from student insights
4. **Multi-level Knowledge**: Transfers output + hidden + attention knowledge
5. **Quality-aware Training**: Avoids learning from poor quality predictions

## 📈 Results Analysis

After training, you'll get:
- **Performance comparison plots** showing AUC scores
- **Detailed analysis report** in Markdown format
- **Model checkpoints** for making new predictions
- **Prediction quality metrics** comparing both approaches

Example outputs:
```
📊 Model Performance Summary:
  • Basic KD Average AUC: 0.678
  • FedKD Average AUC: 0.721
  • FedKD improvement: +0.043 (+6.3%)
  • Hit prediction agreement: 89.2%
```

## 🔮 Making Predictions

### Interactive Mode
```bash
python main.py --predict
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from prediction import predict_with_model, compare_predictions

# Single model prediction
results = predict_with_model(['CCO', 'CC(=O)O'], model_type='fedkd')

# Compare both models
basic_results, fedkd_results, comparison = compare_predictions(['CCO', 'CC(=O)O'])
```

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adjust Model Architecture
Edit `models_basic.py` or `models_fedkd.py`:
```python
# Change model size
hidden_dim=128  # Larger = more capacity
num_layers=4    # Deeper = more complex

# Adjust knowledge distillation
temperature=3.0  # Higher = softer targets
alpha=0.6       # Task loss weight
beta=0.4        # Distillation loss weight
```

### Modify Training Parameters
Edit `training.py`:
```python
epochs=100      # Training duration
lr=1e-3         # Learning rate
batch_size=32   # Batch size
```
